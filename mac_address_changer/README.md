## MAC Address
### What's the MAC Address?
A Network Interface Card (NIC) is a hardware component installed in a computer, or other device, that enables connection to a network. It provides the physical interface between the device and the network media, handling the sending and receiving of data over the network. Each NIC has a unique Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is essential for devices to identify each other, and facilitate communication at the data link layer. NICs can be designed for wired connections, such as Ethernet cards that connect via cables, or for wireless connections, like Wi-Fi adapters utilizing radio waves. For example, a desktop computer might use a wired NIC, along with an Ethernet cable, to connect to a local network, while a laptop uses a wireless NIC to connect via Wi-Fi.
